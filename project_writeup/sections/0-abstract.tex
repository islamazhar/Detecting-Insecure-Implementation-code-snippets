\begin{abstract}
Online programming discussion platforms such as Stack Overflow have a rich source of ready to use code snippets for software developers. 
It is the de-facto place where developers go to find solutions from the coding snippets given as answers to posted problems by the online developer community. 
However, previous research work has shown that developers have a tendency to directly copy-paste insecure code snippets from Stack Overflow into their production level code. 
As a result without any countermeasures Stack Overflow is becoming one of major sources of vulnerability of production level code. 
To address this problem, in this project, we tackle the problem of analyzing code snippets found on Stack overflow. 
This is challenging since code snippets from Stack overflow are often erroneous, incomplete, and lack dependencies which makes it harder to analyze them by state-of-the-art static tools. 
Our goal is to build a static analysis tool that can identify common insecure patterns found on a dataset containing a collection of 1.6K code snippets from Stackoverflow.
