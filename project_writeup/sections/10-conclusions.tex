\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we explore the problem of  identifying insecure patterns on source code snippets given in response to Stack Overflow (SO) questions.  
We motivate the problem by emphasizing that insecurity in code snippets present in SO, 
can potentially trickled down to production level source code -- introducing vulnerabilities.
We believe that by flagging the common 8 insecure patterns compiled from existing literature 
can encourage developers to accept, updvote, share secure code snippets. 
We propose a static analysis tool based on keyword searching and backward flow
analysis to do so. Our experimental result on 1.6K code snippets written in Java language
demonstrates the promising outcome of our proposed solution.
