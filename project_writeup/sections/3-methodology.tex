\subsection{Code Repair}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Syntax error: illegal characters (\&gt;, \&lt;, \&amp;, ..., ""), match brackets, @Overide, 
    \item  Missing class and method names: wrapped the code snippets inside a class, called methods without class, package names.
    \item  importing common crpto classes. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Converting code snippets to IR}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have used PPA. 
    \item Talk about Jimple / AST.
\end{itemize}
\minote{Add a number on how many code snippets you have been able to convert here..}
\subsection{Insecure Patterns}
\minote{How did we come up with these insecure patterns? Say why this is not secure and show one line of example.}

\subsubsection{AES default encryption mode ECB }
\subsubsection{Insecure cryptographic hash}
\subsubsection{Presence of AllHostNameVerifier}
\subsubsection{Abuse of X509TrustManager Verifier Interface}
\subsubsection{Absence of performing hostname verification}
\subsubsection{Weak key length}
\subsubsection{Static/constant/predictable keys/IV }
\subsubsection{Turning of CSRF protection }
\subsubsection{Explicitly seeding random number.}
