\subsection{Data collection} 
  We used dataset from two previous sources ~\cite{meng2018secure,fischer2017stack}. Both of these dataset contain code snippets posted on Stackoverflow. 
  Fisher et al. crawled 1,161 code snippets posted on Stackoverflow related to Andrioid Securuity ~\cite{fischer2017stack}. They considered a code snippet related to Android security if the code snippets makes API calls to
  one of the security services such as Java cryptography, Java secure Communications, public key infrastructure X.509 certificates, and Java authentication - authorization services. The popular crypto libraries used by Andriod developers such as Bouncy Castle, SpongyCastle, Apache TLS/SSL, keyczar, jasypt, and GNU Crypto were also included. 
  
  Meng et al.  extracted 503 code snippets from 22,195 Stackoverflow posts by filtering the posts based on votes, duplications, and absence of code snipeets~\cite{meng2018secure}. In total our study is baded on the dataset by combining these two. Our dataset contains 1,664 code snippets. The timeline of these code snippets are from 2008-2017.
